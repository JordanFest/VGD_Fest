# VGD_Fest
The results of a semester of game engine design.

The general idea of this project was to sandbox the concept of a game engine using a simple javascript based 3d engine.
The basic parsing of the json based scenes was constructed by our professor, while all additional features had to be constructed by the students.

Simple scenes or games were used to demonstrate the capabilities of the engine. 

A localhost setup, such as through python, should be enough to launch the project, which will greet you with a very simple toolbar with each finsished project.

The pong game can be controlled via the 'up and down keys' vs 'w and s keys'.
The FPS demo can be controlled by the arrow keys and spacebar.
